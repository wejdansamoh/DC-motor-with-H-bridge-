DC Motor

A DC (Direct Current) motor is an electric motor that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. It operates on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. Key features include:


Components: A DC motor typically consists of a rotor (armature), a stator, a commutator, brushes, and windings.
Operation: When current flows through the windings, a magnetic field is generated, interacting with the magnetic field of the stator, causing the rotor to turn.
Types: Common types include brushed and brushless DC motors. Brushed motors use brushes to conduct current between stationary wires and the rotating armature, while brushless motors use electronic commutation.


H-Bridge
An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that allows a voltage to be applied across a load in either direction. It is commonly used to control the direction and speed of DC motors. The name "H-bridge" comes from its typical graphical representation, which resembles the letter "H." Key features include:



Components: An H-bridge consists of four switches (transistors or MOSFETs) that control the direction of the current flow through the motor.
Operation: By opening and closing the switches in pairs, the H-bridge can apply the voltage across the motor in either direction, allowing for forward and reverse operation.
Control: The H-bridge can be controlled using digital signals from a microcontroller (like an Arduino) to adjust motor speed and direction.
